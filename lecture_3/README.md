# Janelia ML Course - lecture 3

## Exercises and milestones for lab 3

### Using TensorFlow with Keras for deep learning
1. Make sure you're in your conda environment from last week: `source activate <env-name>`.
1. Make sure numpy is installed:
	`pip install numpy`
   as well as matplotlib:
   	`pip install matplotlib`
3. Install tensorflow:
	`pip install tensorflow`
   and Keras:
    `pip install keras`
4. Open and run the lab\_3.ipynb notebook

### Exercises
1. Use numpy only to construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for XOR
2. Use keras to construct an MLP for another 2D dataset and visualize decision boundaries
3. Use keras to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification
